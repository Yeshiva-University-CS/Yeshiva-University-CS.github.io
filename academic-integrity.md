# Yeshiva College Department of Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy

## Resources & Collaboration

The allowed resources for Computer Science assignments will vary from course to course, and even from assignment to assignment, including:

* what sources of information, printed or online, may be accessed and used,
* the level of collaboration and discussion which is permitted among students,
* whether someone else's previous work may be incorporated, as-is or with changes

The rules may be communicated to the students in several forms, including:
* assignment instructions
* lecture slides
* course syllabi
* class emails
* online class forums (e.g., Canvas, Piazza, GitHub)

Students are responsible to know and follow both the general rules for each course as well as the specific provisions for each assignment. If there is ambiguity about a particular resource, they should assume that its use is not permitted, pending any further clarification by the professor.

## Citing Sources

When submitting work for any assignment for which use or adaptation of code (or other work) written by others has been allowed by the professor, the student is required to follow the citation practices outlined by the professor in the specific course or assignment. If the professor does not outline a specific citation practice, students must do the following:

* Insert the URL of the code and the date of retrieval. Add more details if it will help the reader get a clearer understanding of the source.
* If you adapted the code, you should indicate “Adapted from:” or “Based on” so it is understood that you modified the code.
* If you are not clear on what is required and acceptable, ask your instructor.
