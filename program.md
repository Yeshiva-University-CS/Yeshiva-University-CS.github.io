For more details regarding what the various categories (COWC, HBSI, etc.) mean, what Y.C. courses count towards them, etc. please consult Y.C.â€™s web site or [academic advising](https://www.yu.edu/academic-advising/undergraduate-men).


{: .box-note}
Since B.S. students must be on campus for 8 semesters and there are 8 non-C.S. requirements, B.S. students can take one non-C.S. requirement each semester to pace themselves and evenly distribute their workload.
